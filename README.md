# Asset bundle directory starter template

This is a starter project for creating an asset bundle.

The intention is for this project to codify the basics of building an asset bundle and hopefully makes it easier to get started.

There is an example processors under `asset/reverse` and a set of unit tests under `spec/reverse-spec.js` to demonstrate how you can develop and test simple processors outside of a Teraslice cluster.
